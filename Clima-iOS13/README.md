#  Clima - The Weather App

## About

This weather app utilises OpenWeather's public API (https://openweathermap.org/api) to fetch weather data. Users can enter a city name or use the location button to automatically fetch their current location's weather. The app supports dynamic dark/light theming and iconography automatically changes based on weather conditions.
